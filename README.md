# Summer2023Proj

This is (one of) the summer project(s) I'm working on before Junior year. One of my friends will have edit permissions (if he requests them).

## What is the Project?

The project here is hopefully going to be an RTS gameâ€”the likes of StarCraft, WarCraft, and most things that start with "Age." It's my first experience with C++, so... we'll see how it goes.

My understanding is that, while the reverse is not necessarily true, Unreal's blueprints can basically be directly translated to C++. Again: We'll see how it goes.
